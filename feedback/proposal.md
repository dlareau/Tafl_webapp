### Paul

I would be a little concerned that implementing the game logic might get in the way of you fully demonstrating your knowledge of the course concepts. If you can find ways to robustly show your knowldege of the course concepts, and are willing to then put the extra time in to make the game logic, then I think you've got yourself a great project. For example, in order to demonstrate the course concepts, you will have to make sure you have advanced model interactions.

### Andrew

It seems to me the primary challenges here are implementing game logic and updates to the game players over websockets, and matchmaking, and while it's probably a sufficient project it seems to me the focus here is more on writing a game server that just happens to use a browser-based client than a web application itself. Your current non-game related features of having a leaderboard/view player profiles sort not a lot, so may be a few extra things that aren't game related might be nice.

### Shuai

I like your idea of having a real-time game web application. But on the other hand, implementing game logic could potentially take up a lot of time and workload. The goal of the final project is for you to use and demonstrate technologies you have learned in this course and implementing game logic is mostly out of scope. I would suggest you to take a step back and think about what other features you can make to show more model manipulations and how you can minimalize your effort on the game logic part.
